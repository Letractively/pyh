#summary User manual for the PyH library

= Introduction =

PyH is a very simple python library that lets you write HTML content from within your python program. Hard-coding plain HTML into your python code is boring and can make your code completely unreadable. Plus, once you'll have a look at the source of the HTML file, it won't be readable either. PyH gives you a nice solution for all of this.
==Features==
* Automatic formating of HTML tags
* High customizability
* full CSS awareness
* Automatic tag closure when possible
* Primitive verification of tag hierarchy
